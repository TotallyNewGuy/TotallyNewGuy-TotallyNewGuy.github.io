      - Leveraged perplexity of large language models like BERT to identify trajectory outliers, contributing to the detection of taxi fraud or changes in self-driving car routes.
      - Constructed a customized vocabulary using over 50,000 GPS coordinates and created a adaptive mapping, which link coordinates to words using their spatial distribution and density.
      - Treated each trajectory as a sentence and employed a 7:3 split for training and testing data, introducing artificially missing and drifting coordinates to augment the training data.
      - Applied 16 √ó 16 road netwrok and relative position bias to enhance the model's spatial awareness. Training with Transformer encoder with BERT-style tasks achieved an ~0.8 accuracy and ~0.7 F1 score.
      - Calculated perplexity score of unseen trajectory, employing K-means for binary classification on scores to identify outliers. F1 score of the prediction results surpasses the state-of-the-art model by 9% to 16%.

#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

As a student with dual majors in Computer Science and Urban Planning , I am committed to integrating A.I. to enhance our living environment. I am set to graduate from Northeastern University this year and in the process of applying for a Ph.D. program as I aspire to advance further in my research journey.

Currently, I am serving as a research assistant at MIT Transit Lab, where I am working on utilizing machine learning to optimize bus dispatching. Recently, I am working on my capstone research, introducing a novel approach that enables accurate and efficient identification of trajectory outliers using Large Language Model.

My research interests are Spatio-Temporal Data Mining, Intelligent Transportation System, Smart City, Deep Learning, IoT Network and Cloud Computing.
